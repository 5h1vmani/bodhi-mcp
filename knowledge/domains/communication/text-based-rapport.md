# Text-Based Rapport

> Make them feel heard, respected, and interesting. Everything else is tactics.

## TL;DR

- **Franklin Effect** — ask for their opinion. People like those who make them feel like experts.
- **Validate before contributing** — acknowledge their point before adding yours. Brain relaxes when heard first.
- **Pratfall Effect** — small flaws increase likability, but only AFTER demonstrating competence.
- **Active Constructive** — for achievements, be enthusiastic AND curious ("What was the turning point?").
- **Peak-End Rule** — end strong with a callback to something specific they said.

## Decision Guide

| Scenario                      | Approach                                          | Why                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Want them to like you         | Ask for their opinion/expertise (Franklin Effect) | People like those who make them feel like experts   |
| Want deeper conversation      | Share small vulnerability first                   | Reciprocity: they will match your depth             |
| Already showed competence     | Admit a small flaw (Pratfall Effect)              | Increases perceived likability and trust            |
| They shared an achievement    | Be enthusiastic + ask curious follow-up           | Strongest relationship predictor (Gable's research) |
| Adding your perspective       | Validate their logic first, then extend           | Brain relaxes when it feels heard                   |
| Ending conversation           | Callback to something specific they said          | Peak-End Rule: people remember how it ended         |
| Building ongoing relationship | Short quality interactions regularly              | Mere exposure: consistency beats intensity          |

## The Principles

### 1. The Franklin Effect

Ask someone for their opinion or a small favor. They will like you more, not less.

> "You have probably seen more of this than I have — what is your take?"

### 2. Reciprocity of Self-Disclosure

Share something slightly vulnerable first. They will match your depth.

> "Still figuring this out myself" or "I honestly struggled with that part"

Works powerfully in text because most people posture online. Vulnerability is rare.

### 3. The Pratfall Effect

Competent people become MORE likable when they show a small flaw.

> "Took me way too long to figure that out" or "I got that wrong initially"

**Critical:** Only works if you have already demonstrated competence. Without competence first, flaws just look like flaws.

### 4. Active Constructive Responding

When someone shares good news or an achievement, the highest-rapport response is enthusiastic AND curious.

| Response Type           | Example                                       | Rapport Effect |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Passive Destructive     | Ignoring, changing subject                    | Negative       |
| Passive Constructive    | "Nice!"                                       | Weak           |
| Active Destructive      | "But what about X problem?"                   | Negative       |
| **Active Constructive** | "That is great — what was the turning point?" | **Strongest**  |

This is the single strongest predictor of relationship quality (Shelly Gable's research).

### 5. Validation Before Contribution

From motivational interviewing: always acknowledge what someone said before adding your own point.

> "That makes sense because [their logic]... one thing I would add is..."

The brain literally relaxes when it feels heard first. Skip this and they get defensive.

### 6. The Peak-End Rule

People remember conversations by the emotional peak and how they ended.

Strong endings:

- Genuine compliment
- Callback to something specific they said earlier
- "I am going to look into that X you mentioned"

Even if the middle is average, end strong.

### 7. Mere Exposure Through Consistency

In ongoing text relationships, showing up regularly with short quality interactions beats occasional long conversations.

Familiarity breeds trust. Consistency > intensity.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                        | Fix                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Generic praise ("Great post!")                 | Reference ONE specific point they made   |
| Sharing vulnerability without competence first | Establish credibility, then show flaw    |
| Just "nice!" for achievements                  | Add curious follow-up question           |
| Adding your point without acknowledging theirs | Validate their logic first, then extend  |
| Long occasional messages                       | Short consistent interactions            |
| Ending abruptly                                | Callback to something specific they said |
| Making it about you                            | Ask about THEIR experience               |

## Checklist

- [ ] Does this make them feel heard? (validation first)
- [ ] Does this make them feel like the expert? (Franklin Effect)
- [ ] If sharing a flaw, have I shown competence first? (Pratfall)
- [ ] If they shared a win, am I enthusiastic AND curious? (Active Constructive)
- [ ] Does it end strong? (Peak-End Rule)
- [ ] Is this about their work, not mine?
