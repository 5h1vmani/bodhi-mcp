# Go-To-Market Strategy

> Decision framework for choosing GTM motion, defining ICP, positioning, and staging your go-to-market — from pre-PMF through scale.

## TL;DR

- **Start with ONE GTM motion; add a second only after $10M+ ARR** — $0-2M focus on one motion; $2-10M optimize it; $10M+ layer a second (McKinsey: 65% of buyers prefer both PLG and sales-led experiences)
- **PLG works when users get value in <1 hour without talking to anyone** — free-to-paid median is 2-5%; PQLs convert at 25-30% vs 5-10% for MQLs; 40-60% of free users are "zombie users" who never convert
- **Hybrid PLG+Sales is the 2026 default** — most once-pure PLG public companies now have sales teams; companies with hybrid models report 38% higher revenue growth (OpenView)
- **ICP before channels** — organizations with a strong ICP achieve 68% higher account win rates (HubSpot); build ICP from your best 20% of customers, not aspirational targets
- **GTM efficiency is the new growth** — Rule of 40 is table stakes; top performers target Rule of 50; burn multiple <2.0 is acceptable, <1.0 is elite (David Sacks)

## Decision Guide

### Choosing Your GTM Motion

| Motion             | ACV Sweet Spot | Sales Cycle  | Buyer Type              | When It Works                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| PLG (Product-Led)  | $0-$10K        | Days-weeks   | Self-directed, hands-on | Users get value in <1 hour without sales       |
| Sales-Led          | $50K-$1M+      | 3-12 months  | Committee, procurement  | Complex deals, compliance, high switching cost |
| Hybrid (PLG+Sales) | $10K-$200K     | 2-16 weeks   | Mixed (tech + business) | Self-serve for eval, sales for expansion       |
| Community-Led      | $2K-$50K       | Weeks-months | Developers, technical   | Open source, developer tools, ecosystem        |
| Partner-Led        | $5K-$100K      | Weeks-months | Via channel             | Marketplace, integrations, geographic reach    |

**Decision tree:**

1. Can users get value in <1 hour without talking to anyone? YES → PLG. NO → Sales-led or Hybrid.
2. Is ACV >$50K with 3+ stakeholders? YES → Sales-led. NO → PLG or Hybrid.
3. Do you have an open-source/developer community? YES → Community-led with monetization layer.

### PLG Benchmarks

| Metric                              | Bottom Quartile | Median       | Top Quartile |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Free-to-paid conversion             | <1%             | 2-5%         | 5-8%         |
| PQL → customer                      | <15%            | 25%          | 30-39%       |
| Time-to-value                       | >1 hour         | 15-30 min    | <5 min       |
| CAC payback                         | >24 months      | 12-18 months | <6 months    |
| NRR                                 | <100%           | 100-110%     | 120%+        |
| Website visitor → signup (freemium) | <3%             | 6%           | 10%+         |
| Website visitor → signup (trial)    | <2%             | 3-4%         | 5%+          |

**91% of B2B SaaS companies are increasing PLG investment (2025), but only 27% report sustained YoY expansion** — most are acquiring free users faster than they can retain them.

### GTM by Company Stage

| Stage    | ARR      | GTM Focus                                                     | Key Hires                        | S&M Budget (% ARR) |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Pre-PMF  | $0-500K  | Founder-led sales; 5-10 design partners; test 1 channel       | None (founder sells)             | 10-20%             |
| Growth   | $500K-5M | Repeatable playbook; first AE pair; first marketer at $1M     | Sales Director, Content Marketer | 30-45%             |
| Scale    | $5M-20M  | Multi-channel; territory planning; demand gen engine          | VP Sales, PMM, Sales Ops         | 40-55%             |
| Maturity | $20M+    | Efficiency optimization; new market expansion; product as GTM | CRO, Partner Manager, Enablement | 35-50%             |

### Stage Transition Triggers

| Signal            | Pre-PMF → Growth      | Growth → Scale        | Scale → Maturity           |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| ARR               | $100-500K             | $3-5M                 | $15-20M                    |
| Customers         | 10-20 paid            | 50-100                | 200+                       |
| Sales cycle       | Predictable <6 months | 2+ validated channels | 3+ differentiated segments |
| LTV:CAC           | >1:1 (validating)     | >3:1                  | >5:1                       |
| NRR               | Establishing          | 100-120%              | >120%                      |
| Top 3 customers % | <60% of revenue       | <30%                  | <20%                       |

### ICP Definition Framework

| Dimension     | What to Define                         | Example                                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Firmographic  | Industry, size, revenue, location      | B2B SaaS, 50-500 employees, $5M-50M revenue            |
| Technographic | Tools, platforms, stack                | Uses Salesforce CRM, AWS infrastructure                |
| Behavioral    | Buying signals, content engagement     | Visited pricing page 2x, downloaded whitepaper         |
| Intent        | Active research, competitor evaluation | Searching for "[your category]", following competitors |
| Anti-ICP      | Who you explicitly exclude             | Pre-revenue startups, government, <10 employees        |

**Build ICP from your best 20% of customers** (3x+ median LTV), not aspirational targets. Companies without ICP become "Jack of all trades" with generic positioning.

### Positioning (April Dunford Framework)

| Element                  | Question to Answer                            |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Competitive alternatives | What would customers use if you didn't exist? |
| Unique attributes        | What do you have that alternatives don't?     |
| Value                    | What value do those attributes enable?        |
| Target customers         | Who cares most about that value?              |
| Market category          | What context makes your value obvious?        |

**Rule:** Position for your best-fit customers first, then expand. Don't try to be everything to everyone.

## GTM Efficiency Metrics

| Metric        | Formula                                 | Acceptable | Elite      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Burn Multiple | Cash Burn / Net New ARR                 | <2.0       | <1.0       |
| Magic Number  | QoQ ARR Growth / Prior Q S&M Spend      | ≥0.75      | >1.0       |
| Rule of 40    | Revenue Growth % + Profit Margin %      | ≥40%       | ≥50%+      |
| CAC Payback   | CAC / (Gross Margin per Customer/Month) | <18 months | <12 months |
| LTV:CAC       | Customer Lifetime Value / CAC           | >3:1       | >5:1       |

**2026 trends:** Rule of 40 is table stakes; top performers target Rule of 50. 1-point increase in revenue growth has ~2x the valuation impact of equivalent FCF margin increase. Expansion revenue should drive 40-60% of growth at $15M+ ARR.

## AI in GTM (2026)

| Area            | What's Working                                                         | What's Overhyped                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prospecting     | AI SDRs deliver 4-7x conversion at 70% lower cost for initial outreach | Autonomous SDRs as full rep replacement                   |
| Content         | AI-generated first drafts at scale; programmatic SEO                   | AI content without human voice editing                    |
| Forecasting     | 15-25% accuracy lift with 12+ months clean data                        | Predictive models without historical baseline             |
| Lead scoring    | Signal-based selling across 75+ intent indicators                      | Scoring without PQL data                                  |
| Personalization | Hyper-relevant list targeting > hyper-personalized messages            | "I saw your post about X" AI openers (everyone does this) |

**70% of high-growth companies have moderate-to-full AI adoption in GTM workflows (ZoomInfo 2025).** AI-native companies grow 2-3x faster than top-quartile SaaS benchmarks.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                     | Fix                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trying all GTM motions simultaneously       | Pick ONE motion; master it; add second only after $10M+ ARR and first motion at 3:1 LTV:CAC                   |
| Scaling GTM before PMF                      | If monthly churn >5% or NPS <40, fix product first; GTM amplifies what you have                               |
| Hiring VP Sales at $300K ARR                | No playbook to manage; hire Sales Director first; founder stays involved until $1.5M ARR                      |
| Running paid ads before messaging validated | Test messaging via 50+ manual conversations first; scale ads only after >15% conversion rate                  |
| Broad ICP targeting everyone                | Focus on best 20% of existing customers; specific ICP delivers 68% higher win rates                           |
| PLG without activation tracking             | 40-60% of free users are zombies; only 34% of PLG companies track activation                                  |
| Ignoring expansion revenue                  | New logo CAC rose 14% in 2025; expansion CAC stays flat; 40-60% of growth should come from existing customers |
