## Key Principles

1. **"You" > "We"** - Customer-focused, not company-focused
2. **Verifiable > persuasive** - Claims users can check beat clever copy
3. **Specific numbers** - "47% improvement" not "significant improvement"
4. **One CTA per piece** - Don't compete with yourself
5. **Authentic voice** - Sound like a knowledgeable friend, not a corporation
6. **Acknowledge limitations** - Honesty builds more trust than perfection

## Quick Reference

### Voice Rules

| Do                            | Don't                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| "Here's what works"           | "We believe we might help" |
| Short sentences (12-18 words) | Long paragraphs            |
| Specific numbers              | "Many," "significant"      |
| Contractions (don't, won't)   | Formal language            |
| One clear CTA                 | Multiple competing CTAs    |

### Trust Hierarchy

1. Verifiable outcomes with data
2. Named testimonials with specific results
3. Aggregate statistics ("50,000+ users")
4. Logos/partnerships
5. Generic praise (weakest)

### Banned Phrases

```
❌ "Guaranteed results"
❌ "Only X seats left" (unless true)
❌ "Best in the industry"
❌ "Revolutionary"
❌ "Dear valued customer"
```
