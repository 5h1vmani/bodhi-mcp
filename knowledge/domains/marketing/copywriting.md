# Copywriting Best Practices

> Guidelines for writing clear, trustworthy, conversion-focused copy.

## TL;DR

- Use **"you" > "we"** - customer-focused, not company-focused
- **Front-load value** - most important info first
- **Specific numbers** > vague claims ("47% improvement" not "significant improvement")
- Keep sentences **under 20 words** average
- **One CTA per piece** - don't compete with yourself
- Gen Z: **skepticism is default** - make claims verifiable

## Decision Guide

| Scenario                       | Approach                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cold traffic (ads, SEO)**    | Hook + proof + single clear outcome. Trust-building critical. |
| **Warm leads (email nurture)** | Empathetic tone, educational value, softer CTA.               |
| **Hot leads (pricing, demo)**  | Remove friction, answer objections, direct CTA.               |
| **Feature launch**             | Outcome first, feature second. Use specific user benefit.     |
| **Technical audience**         | Keep approachable voice, add precision. Avoid dumbing down.   |
| **Skeptical/Gen Z**            | Verifiable claims, no hype. Show receipts upfront.            |
| **Re-engagement/churn**        | Acknowledge gap, offer clear value, low commitment ask.       |
| **Building brand awareness**   | Story-driven, relatable scenarios, no hard sell.              |

## Voice Framework

### The Approachable Expert

Your brand voice should sound like a knowledgeable friend, not a corporation.

| Attribute      | What It Sounds Like                        | What It Doesn't Sound Like                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Confident**  | "Here's what works."                       | "We believe we might be able to help..."       |
| **Empathetic** | "This is frustrating. Let's fix it."       | "Don't worry, everything will be fine!"        |
| **Direct**     | "This won't help if you're not committed." | "Results may vary based on individual effort." |
| **Warm**       | "You've got this. Here's the next step."   | "Dear valued customer..."                      |
| **Honest**     | "We can't promise X. We can promise Y."    | "Guaranteed results!"                          |

## Language Rules

### Do

| Rule                     | Example                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Use "you" more than "we" | "You'll see results" not "We deliver results" |
| Keep sentences short     | Average 12-18 words                           |
| Use contractions         | don't, won't, can't                           |
| Ask direct questions     | "Struggling with X?"                          |
| Use specific numbers     | "73% of users" not "most users"               |
| One clear CTA            | Single action per piece                       |
| Front-load value         | Important info first                          |

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Vague quantifiers       | "Many," "significant," "various"           |

| Multiple CTAs           | "Sign up, follow us, share this, download" |
| Formal salutations      | "Dear valued customer"                     |
| Sentences over 25 words | Break them up                              |
| Rhetorical fluff        | "Ever wondered why...?"                    |

## Gen Z Communication

Gen Z (born 1997-2012) begins from skepticism. They verify claims at 3.7x the rate of previous generations.

### What Works

| Trait                 | Implication                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Skeptical by default  | Make claims verifiable          |
| Research-heavy        | 72% verify before purchasing    |
| Short attention span  | Bite-sized, scannable content   |
| Authenticity-obsessed | Reject polished corporate speak |
| Visual communicators  | Prefer images, video over text  |

### What Destroys Trust

- Fake scarcity ("Only 3 left!")
- Unrealistic claims
- Over-polished testimonials
- Influencer partnerships that feel inauthentic
- Profit-focus visibility

### Channel Preferences

| Channel     | Preference                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Text/DM     | #1 - Primary communication |
| Short video | #2 - Discovery, learning   |
| Instagram   | #3 - Visual identity       |
| YouTube     | #4 - Deep dives            |
| Email       | Tolerated for transactions |
| Phone calls | Avoided                    |

## Persuasion Structures

### Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS)

Research shows PAS outperforms hero's journey for conversion copy. 68% of marketers using problem-focused copy see higher lead engagement.

```
1. Problem — State the pain clearly
2. Agitate — Deepen it; make them feel it
3. Solve — Present your solution

Example:
"Losing deals to competitors? (Problem)
Every week you wait, they're closing your prospects.
Your pipeline shrinks while theirs grows. (Agitate)
Our competitive intel tool shows you exactly what
they're offering—before you walk into the room. (Solve)"
```

**Why it works:** Agitation creates emotional stakes before the solution appears. Skipping agitation = weaker conversion.

### Before-After-Bridge (BAB)

Best for transformation-focused products.

```
1. Before — Current painful state
2. After — Desired future state
3. Bridge — How you get them there
```

### Features-Advantages-Benefits (FAB)

Best for technical audiences who need specifics.

```
1. Feature — What it is
2. Advantage — Why that matters technically
3. Benefit — What it means for them
```

## Headlines

### Structure

```
[Outcome] + [Timeframe/Specificity] + [Qualifier if needed]

Examples:
"Reduce churn by 23% in 30 days"
"Write landing pages that convert—based on 500 A/B tests"
"The honest guide to [topic]"
```

### Rules

- Under 8 words
- Front-load the value
- Be specific, not clever
- Promise only what you deliver

## CTAs

### Single CTA Rule

One primary CTA per piece. Multiple CTAs compete with each other.

### CTA Formula

```
[Action verb] + [What they get]

Examples:
"Start your free trial"
"Get the checklist"
"See pricing"
```

### Avoid

- "Click here"
- "Submit"
- "Learn more" (too vague)
- Multiple CTAs fighting for attention

## Email Copy

### Subject Lines

- Under 50 characters
- Curiosity or clear value
- Don't repeat in preview text

### Structure

```
1. Hook (first line matters)
2. Context (why this matters)
3. Value (what they get)
4. CTA (one action)
```

### Length

- Nurture emails: under 200 words
- Transactional: as short as possible
- Newsletter: scannable sections

## Claim Qualification

All outcomes must be qualified:

```
✓ "Users who completed 80%+ of onboarding saw 47% better retention."

✗ "Users see 47% better retention."
```

### Attribution Format

```
"[Claim] — based on [sample size] [user type] from [time period]"

Example:
"Average 23% conversion lift — based on 847 sites from Jan-Dec 2024"
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake               | Fix                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Leading with features | Lead with outcomes, explain features second |
| Vague claims          | Use specific numbers with sources           |
| Corporate voice       | Write like you're explaining to a friend    |
| Multiple CTAs         | One clear action per piece                  |
| Long paragraphs       | Max 3-4 sentences per paragraph             |
| Fake urgency          | Real value > artificial scarcity            |

## Checklist

Before publishing copy:

- [ ] Value is front-loaded (first sentence matters)
- [ ] "You" used more than "we"
- [ ] Sentences average under 20 words
- [ ] All claims are specific and verifiable
- [ ] Single, clear CTA
- [ ] No banned phrases
- [ ] Tone matches context
- [ ] Would pass the "friend test" (would you say this to a friend?)
