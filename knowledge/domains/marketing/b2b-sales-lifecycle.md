# B2B Sales Lifecycle

> End-to-end decision framework for building and running B2B sales — from founder-led selling through team scaling, qualification, closing, and expansion.

## TL;DR

- **Founder-led sales until $500K-$1M ARR** — hire first AE only after you have a repeatable playbook and 10-20 customers; always hire in pairs
- **BANT for SMB (<60 day cycles), MEDDIC for enterprise (6+ month cycles)** — 73% of SaaS companies above $100K ACV use MEDDIC; hybrid (BANT top-of-funnel, MEDDIC mid-funnel) outperforms either alone
- **Case studies are the highest-converting buyer-facing collateral** — 47% of buyers consume 3-5 pieces before engaging sales; battle cards boost win rates 5-10% but only if kept to 1 page
- **ABM delivers 208% more marketing-generated revenue** — but only works above $100K ACV with 10+ person sales teams; below that, targeted outbound wins
- **Expansion revenue costs $0.27 per dollar vs $1.13 for new logos** — top-quartile NRR companies (113%+) trade at 5x higher valuation multiples

## Decision Guide

### When to Hire (Team Building)

| Stage          | ARR        | Action                                        | Org Model     |
| -------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Pre-PMF        | $0-120K    | Founder sells; no hires                       | None          |
| Early traction | $120K-500K | Add lead gen support (VA, junior SDR)         | Island        |
| Growth         | $500K-1M   | First dedicated closer(s); hire in pairs      | Island        |
| Scaling        | $1M-5M     | Specialized SDR/AE pairs; first sales manager | Pod           |
| Maturity       | $5M+       | Full team with VP Sales, ops, enablement      | Assembly line |

### How to Qualify

| Factor          | BANT                   | MEDDIC               | MEDDPICC                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Deal complexity | Simple / transactional | Complex / enterprise | Highly complex                 |
| Sales cycle     | <60 days               | 3-12 months          | 6-24 months                    |
| Stakeholders    | 1-3                    | 5+                   | 8-15+                          |
| Learning curve  | Low                    | ~3.6 months          | High                           |
| Win rate lift   | Baseline               | +15%                 | +18% higher, +24% larger deals |

### Lead Generation Motion

| ACV       | Primary Motion        | Secondary        | ABM?   |
| --------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| <$10K     | PLG + inbound content | Cold email       | No     |
| $10K-50K  | Inbound + outbound    | Paid ads         | Lite   |
| $50K-100K | Outbound + inbound    | Events, partners | Hybrid |
| $100K+    | ABM + outbound        | Partner channels | Full   |

### Collateral by Funnel Stage

| Stage         | Collateral                                       | Format           | Impact                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Awareness     | Thought leadership, industry reports             | Blog, PDF, video | Builds credibility                 |
| Consideration | Case studies, comparison guides, ROI calculators | PDF, interactive | 30-40% conversion lift             |
| Evaluation    | Battle cards (internal), technical specs         | 1-page scannable | 5-10% win rate boost               |
| Decision      | Proposals, references, compliance docs           | Custom per-deal  | +25-30% acceptance when customized |

### Closing and Negotiation

| Scenario              | Approach                                                            | Why                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Price objection       | Lead with ROI quantification, not price defense                     | Anchors on value; "if we save $200K, would $40K investment make sense?" |
| Discount request      | Trade for commitment (longer contract, upfront payment, case study) | Never give without getting; concession matrix prevents margin erosion   |
| Deal stalled          | Introduce mutual action plan with shared milestones                 | Transparency and accountability unstick 60%+ of stalled deals           |
| Multiple stakeholders | Multi-thread across 5-6 contacts by persona type                    | Single-threaded deals fail 3x more often in enterprise                  |
| Procurement/legal     | Map paper process early (MEDDPICC "P")                              | Legal timelines add 30-60 days; knowing early prevents surprise         |

### Post-Sale Expansion

| Scenario            | Approach                                                                 | Why                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Upsell timing       | After customer hits activation milestone (60+ days, 2+ features adopted) | Premature upsell attempts damage trust and increase churn                           |
| Cross-sell          | Tied to adjacent team/department use case discovery in QBR               | Organic expansion through demonstrated value, not cold pitch                        |
| Churn risk detected | Intervene within 48 hours of usage drop signal                           | 20% of voluntary churn is linked to poor onboarding; usage drop is the #1 predictor |
| Renewal             | Start process 90 days before expiry; justify price increases with data   | Late renewal conversations create leverage for buyer                                |
| Advocacy            | Activate after successful renewal + NPS >8                               | Happy customers refer at 30-50% conversion — highest of any channel                 |

## Discovery Call Structure

| Time      | Activity                               | Goal                                          |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 0-3 min   | Warm-up, set agenda                    | Rapport; "my goal today is to understand X"   |
| 3-5 min   | Role and context                       | Understand authority level                    |
| 5-15 min  | Current state, challenges (open-ended) | Surface pain; "what's frustrating?"           |
| 15-25 min | Deep dive on priority pain             | Quantify impact; "what's the financial cost?" |
| 25-35 min | Success vision, timeline               | Desired state, urgency                        |
| 35-40 min | Authority, process, budget             | Qualify BANT/MEDDIC elements                  |
| 40-45 min | Next steps, champion ID                | Secure commitment                             |

**Rule:** Buyer talks 70%, you talk 30%. Top performers disqualify within 2 calls; average reps string along 4-6 weeks.

## The 2026 Sales Reckoning (AI Impact)

| Shift       | Old Model                                      | New Model                                                                           |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SDR role    | Human handles prospecting, sequencing, booking | AI SDR agents handle 80% of prospecting; humans handle replies and complex accounts |
| AE profile  | Traditional closer + relationship builder      | Part engineer, part consultant, part implementation specialist                      |
| Content     | Marketing creates, sales distributes           | Employee-led content multiplies reach and trust                                     |
| Forecasting | Gut + spreadsheet                              | AI-assisted prediction (15-25% accuracy lift when trained properly)                 |
| Cold email  | Primary outbound channel                       | Declining effectiveness; LinkedIn and AI agents replacing                           |

**AI SDR platforms to watch:** Landbase (825% revenue growth 2025), Artisan (Ava), Apollo, Regie.ai, Qualified (Piper). AI SDRs deliver 4-7x higher conversion at 70% lower cost but require human handoff for complex deals.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                                       | Fix                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hiring first salesperson before repeatable playbook exists    | Do founder-led sales until 10-20 customers; document what works before delegating                         |
| Using BANT for enterprise deals with 10+ stakeholders         | Switch to MEDDIC/MEDDPICC; BANT misses champion, decision process, and paper process                      |
| Generic proposals with boilerplate language                   | Customize scope to reference specific buyer conversations; +25-30% acceptance                             |
| Single-threading enterprise deals through one contact         | Multi-thread across 5-6 stakeholders by persona; single-thread deals fail 3x more                         |
| Pushing upsell before customer achieves first value milestone | Wait for activation (60+ days, feature adoption proven); premature upsell increases churn                 |
| Ignoring "interested then ghosted" prospects                  | Tag, follow up 3x, then bucket for content retargeting; high-value marketing data                         |
| Treating all competitors equally in battle cards              | Focus on top 2-3 competitors only; 1-page scannable format gets 70%+ rep adoption                         |
| Discounting without getting concessions in return             | Use concession matrix: trade discounts for longer contracts, upfront payment, or case study participation |
