# Company Brand Identity

> How to apply archetype, voice, and positioning frameworks to a company (not just a founder). Covers scaling voice across teams, touchpoint consistency, the founder-company brand relationship, and brand guidelines that actually get followed. For foundational frameworks (Jung, Fiske, Aaker, Kapferer, StoryBrand), see [founder-brand-identity.md](./founder-brand-identity.md).

## TL;DR

- **Company archetype = founder archetype (early stage); diverges at scale** -- pre-Series A, founder IS the brand; post-product-market-fit, the company brand must stand independently; the transition is the hardest branding moment
- **Brand guidelines fail when they describe, not decide** -- 85% of organizations have brand guidelines; only 30% enforce them consistently; effective guidelines answer "What would we say?" not "What does our logo look like?"
- **Touchpoints, not just content** -- company branding covers product UI, onboarding emails, error messages, support tickets, invoices, packaging, office decor; every touchpoint either reinforces or contradicts the archetype
- **Voice must scale through decisions, not rules** -- "Be professional" fails; "We are the Sage: teach, don't sell; explain, don't impress; simplify, don't dumb down" succeeds; archetype-based guidelines are 3x easier to apply than adjective lists
- **Founder brand amplifies company brand (and vice versa)** -- 63% more likely to buy from company with active CEO (Edelman); founder and company should share archetype but express it differently

## Decision Guide

### When to Formalize Company Brand (vs Riding Founder Brand)

| Stage                        | Brand Strategy                                         | Why                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pre-PMF (0-10 customers)     | Founder IS the brand; don't invest in company branding | Nobody knows or cares about the company yet; founder credibility drives all trust                          |
| Early PMF (10-100 customers) | Founder brand primary, company brand emerging          | Start consistency: logo, colors, one-liner; but founder still does 80% of external comms                   |
| Growth (100-1000 customers)  | **Formalize company brand; founder brand supports**    | New hires need to represent brand; customers interact with team, not just founder; brand guidelines needed |
| Scale (1000+ customers)      | Company brand primary, founder brand amplifies         | Company must stand alone; founder is "voice of" not "the brand"; CEO departure shouldn't destroy brand     |

### Company Archetype Selection

Same 12 archetypes apply (see [founder-brand-identity.md](./founder-brand-identity.md) for full decision guide). Key difference: company archetype must work across ALL touchpoints, not just founder content.

| Touchpoint         | How Archetype Expresses                                       | Sage Example                                                   | Creator Example                                                                 | Hero Example                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product UI / UX    | Information hierarchy, empty states, tooltips, error messages | Clear explanations; "Learn more" links; educational tooltips   | Clean craft; delightful interactions; "We built this for you"                   | Progress indicators; achievement celebrations; "You did it!"    |
| Onboarding emails  | Welcome sequence tone, educational pace                       | "Here's what to know first" (teach); structured sequence       | "Look what you can build" (inspire); showcase possibilities                     | "Your first win is 5 minutes away" (challenge); action-oriented |
| Error messages     | How failure is communicated                                   | "Here's what happened and why" (explain)                       | "Oops, something broke. We're fixing it." (honest craft)                        | "Don't worry, we've got this" (reassurance + action)            |
| Support / CS       | Response style, escalation language                           | Detailed explanations; links to docs; root cause shared        | Acknowledge + fix timeline + "we're building a fix so this never happens again" | "We're on it. Here's the action plan. Updated in 2 hours."      |
| Sales / proposals  | Pitch language, competitive positioning                       | "Here's the data on why this approach works"                   | "Here's what we built that nobody else has"                                     | "Here's the transformation your team will experience"           |
| Pricing page       | Framing, tier names, CTA language                             | "Choose the plan that fits your learning stage"                | "Starter / Pro / Enterprise" (capability-focused)                               | "Essential / Growth / Scale" (transformation-focused)           |
| Job postings       | Employer brand expression                                     | "Join a team that values depth over speed"                     | "Build things that don't exist yet"                                             | "Make an impact that matters"                                   |
| 404 / empty states | Personality in micro-moments                                  | "This page doesn't exist. Here's where to find what you need." | "Nothing here yet. But you could build something..."                            | "Lost? Let's get you back on track."                            |

### Founder ↔ Company Brand Relationship

| Model                         | When to Use                                                          | Example                                                                       | Risk                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Founder = Company**         | Pre-PMF; solo founder; consulting/agency                             | Gary Vee = VaynerMedia; Dharmesh Shah = HubSpot (early)                       | Company can't survive founder departure; every founder misstep = company crisis              |
| **Founder amplifies Company** | Growth-to-scale; founder is visible CEO but company has own identity | Satya Nadella + Microsoft; Brian Chesky + Airbnb                              | Best model for funded companies; requires active brand separation work                       |
| **Founder is invisible**      | Founder chooses to stay behind product; mature company               | Many enterprise SaaS; privacy-focused brands                                  | Misses the 63% trust uplift from visible CEO; harder to attract talent without founder story |
| **Multiple founders visible** | Co-founder teams; different audiences per founder                    | Stripe (Patrick = product, John = culture); Notion (Ivan = design philosophy) | Requires archetype alignment; conflicting voices fragment brand                              |

### Scaling Voice Across a Team

| Approach                                            | Effectiveness                                           | When to Use                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Adjective list ("Be professional, friendly, clear") | **Low** -- too vague; everyone interprets differently   | Never as standalone; use only as supporting detail                                                                       |
| Do / Don't examples                                 | **Medium** -- concrete but limited to examples given    | Good supplement; 10-20 examples per context                                                                              |
| **Archetype-based guidelines**                      | **High** -- provides decision framework, not just rules | Primary method; "We are the Sage, so we always explain WHY, not just WHAT"                                               |
| Voice decision tree                                 | **High** -- flowchart for edge cases                    | For support teams, sales teams; "If customer is frustrated → empathize first (Caregiver mode), then explain (Sage mode)" |
| Tone spectrum per context                           | **High** -- maps formality/emotion to situations        | For teams that write across contexts (marketing writes blog AND emails AND ads)                                          |

### Building an Archetype-Based Brand Guide

| Section                        | What It Answers                                            | How to Write It                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Archetype declaration          | "Who are we?"                                              | "We are the Sage-Creator. We teach through what we build." One sentence.          |
| 3-word voice                   | "How do we sound?"                                         | Same framework as founder (see founder-brand-identity.md); applies company-wide   |
| Tone spectrum                  | "How does our voice shift by context?"                     | Table mapping context → tone; 6-8 contexts minimum                                |
| Do / Don't per archetype       | "What would we say vs never say?"                          | 10-20 paired examples; organized by archetype behavior                            |
| Touchpoint guide               | "How does archetype show up in product / email / support?" | One page per major touchpoint; before/after examples                              |
| Founder voice vs company voice | "How do founder posts differ from company posts?"          | Same archetype, different expression; founder = personal; company = institutional |
| Escalation guide               | "What happens when brand voice conflicts with situation?"  | Decision tree for crisis, complaints, legal situations                            |

## Archetype Do / Don't Quick Reference

| Archetype     | Always Do                                                                            | Never Do                                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Hero**      | Challenge the audience to act; celebrate their wins; acknowledge struggle; be direct | Overpromise; shame inaction; claim credit for their transformation            |
| **Caregiver** | Lead with empathy; check in; anticipate needs; make things easy                      | Be pushy; ignore complaints; prioritize efficiency over care                  |
| **Outlaw**    | Challenge conventions; name the enemy; be provocative; back it with action           | Attack individuals; be contrarian without substance; alienate without purpose |
| **Ruler**     | Set standards; be the definitive source; communicate with authority                  | Be elitist; dismiss alternatives; gatekeep access                             |
| **Explorer**  | Share discoveries; invite the audience along; stay curious; embrace uncertainty      | Settle for "good enough"; follow trends; stay safe                            |
| **Jester**    | Surprise and delight; use humor to make points; break patterns                       | Be inappropriate; undermine serious moments; sacrifice clarity for laughs     |

## Touchpoint Consistency Audit

| Touchpoint                        | Check                                                     | Common Failure                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Homepage                          | Does the hero section express the archetype in 5 seconds? | Generic stock photo + "We help businesses grow" (no archetype)                         |
| Onboarding email sequence         | Does email 1 set the archetype tone?                      | Corporate template voice that doesn't match social/website                             |
| Error messages                    | Do they express brand personality?                        | Technical jargon or generic "Something went wrong"                                     |
| Pricing page                      | Does tier naming reflect archetype?                       | Generic "Basic / Pro / Enterprise" when archetype demands something distinctive        |
| Support macros / canned responses | Are they written in brand voice?                          | Copy-pasted templates with no personality; "Dear valued customer"                      |
| Invoice / receipts                | Even transactional emails on brand?                       | Often forgotten; default platform template                                             |
| Social media replies              | Does community manager know the archetype?                | Inconsistent: sometimes funny, sometimes corporate, sometimes generic                  |
| Job descriptions                  | Do they attract archetype-aligned talent?                 | HR-standard language that contradicts brand personality                                |
| Product microcopy                 | Buttons, tooltips, empty states, confirmations            | "Submit" instead of archetype-appropriate CTA; "No items found" instead of personality |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                                                | Fix                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Brand guidelines that only cover visual identity (logo, colors, fonts) | Visual is ~30% of brand; voice, archetype, tone, touchpoint behavior are the other 70%                               |
| Different voice on social vs product vs support                        | All touchpoints must express the same archetype; tone shifts, voice doesn't                                          |
| Letting each team define their own voice                               | Brand team defines archetype + voice; each team gets context-specific tone guidance                                  |
| Founder and company saying different things                            | Same archetype, different expression: founder = personal stories; company = institutional authority                  |
| "Be authentic" without a framework                                     | Authenticity comes from archetype consistency, not from improvisation; give teams decision tools, not vibes          |
| Hiring writers without archetype onboarding                            | Every writer (content, UX, support, marketing) should do a 30-minute archetype briefing before writing anything      |
| Ignoring product microcopy as branding                                 | Users spend more time with product text than marketing; empty states, error messages, and tooltips ARE your brand    |
| Rebranding too frequently                                              | Archetype consistency builds equity over years; 97% value premium for tightly-defined identities; don't chase trends |
| Only auditing brand when something feels "off"                         | Quarterly touchpoint audit (see checklist); consistency degrades gradually, not suddenly                             |
