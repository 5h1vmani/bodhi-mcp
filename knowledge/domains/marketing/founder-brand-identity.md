# Founder Brand Identity & Positioning

> Decision framework for choosing your brand archetype, voice, and positioning as a founder in any industry -- grounded in Jung's archetypes, Fiske's warmth-competence model, Aaker's brand personality research, and Kapferer's identity prism. This is the identity layer that sits beneath all tactical playbooks (content, typography, influencer).

## TL;DR

- **Lead with warmth, prove competence** -- Fiske's Stereotype Content Model: people judge warmth (intent) BEFORE competence (capability); founders who signal competence without warmth trigger envy, not admiration; the goal is high-warmth + high-competence = admiration quadrant
- **Pick one primary archetype, one secondary** -- brands with "tightly defined" archetypal identities rose 97% more in value over 6 years than confused brands (Mark & Pearson); pick primary by industry (Sage for knowledge, Creator for innovation, Hero for transformation, Outlaw for disruption)
- **You are the Guide, not the Hero** -- StoryBrand SB7: your customer is the hero; you are the guide who shows empathy + authority; founders who position themselves as the hero repel; guides who elevate their customer attract
- **Voice = 3 words, Tone = context-dependent** -- define your brand voice in exactly 3 words (e.g., "Insightful, Direct, Grounded"); tone shifts across contexts (social = casual-confident, pitch deck = authoritative-visionary, support = empathetic-clear)
- **Competence and Excitement drive brand equity (2025)** -- Aaker's 18-year panel study (n=49,626): excitement + competence dimensions have growing positive effects on brand equity; sincerity, sophistication, and ruggedness are declining

## Decision Guide

### Choosing Your Brand Archetype

| Founder Type                        | Primary Archetype | Secondary | Brand Examples                       | Risk to Manage                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Knowledge / education / consulting  | **Sage**          | Creator   | Google, Khan Academy, McKinsey       | Can feel dry/academic without Creator energy                   |
| AI-native / deep tech / R&D         | **Creator**       | Sage      | Apple, Adobe, Tesla                  | Can feel unfocused without Sage credibility anchor             |
| Health / fitness / social impact    | **Hero**          | Caregiver | Nike, TED, Peloton                   | Can feel aggressive/over-promising; temper with groundedness   |
| Community / support / healthcare    | **Caregiver**     | Sage      | Johnson & Johnson, TOMS, Headspace   | Can feel soft; add Sage authority to avoid seeming unambitious |
| Disruption / challenger brand       | **Outlaw**        | Creator   | Virgin, Harley-Davidson, Notion      | Polarizing; not for founders needing broad trust quickly       |
| Platform / marketplace / enterprise | **Ruler**         | Caregiver | Salesforce, Microsoft, Stripe        | Can feel arrogant; add Caregiver warmth signals                |
| Consumer / lifestyle / creative     | **Explorer**      | Creator   | Patagonia, Airbnb, GoPro             | Can feel aimless; anchor with Creator's build-orientation      |
| Luxury / premium / fashion          | **Magician**      | Ruler     | Disney, Dyson, Chanel                | Can feel inaccessible; needs aspirational pull not exclusion   |
| Entertainment / Gen Z / social      | **Jester**        | Everyman  | Wendy's, Dollar Shave Club, Duolingo | Can undermine credibility if overused; pair with substance     |
| Fintech / insurance / B2B trust     | **Everyman**      | Sage      | IKEA, Costco, Zerodha                | Can feel unremarkable; add Sage expertise to differentiate     |

### Industry × Archetype Quick Reference

| Industry              | Strongest Primary  | Why                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| EdTech / Learning     | Sage               | Trust in knowledge authority is the purchase driver |
| SaaS / Dev Tools      | Creator            | Users buy innovation + craft                        |
| Healthcare / Wellness | Caregiver + Sage   | Warmth + expertise = clinical trust                 |
| Fintech / Finance     | Everyman + Sage    | Democratization + competence = reliability          |
| D2C / Consumer        | Explorer or Jester | Aspiration or delight drives purchase               |
| Enterprise / B2B      | Ruler + Sage       | Authority + depth = procurement confidence          |
| Social Impact / NGO   | Hero + Caregiver   | Empowerment + nurture = donor/volunteer trust       |
| Luxury / Premium      | Magician + Ruler   | Transformation + exclusivity = aspirational pull    |
| Agency / Consulting   | Sage + Creator     | Knowledge + craft = "they'll solve our problem"     |
| Media / Content       | Jester or Sage     | Entertainment or authority, rarely both             |

### The Warmth-Competence Positioning Matrix (Fiske)

| Quadrant                          | Perception              | Audience Response                      | Founder Behavior                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High Warmth + High Competence** | Admired, trusted leader | Admiration → follow, buy, invest, join | Share vulnerability + credentials; teach generously + show results; "I built this AND here's how you can too" |
| High Warmth + Low Competence      | Nice but not capable    | Pity → patronize, ignore               | Trap for founders who over-index on being "relatable" without showing capability                              |
| Low Warmth + High Competence      | Impressive but cold     | Envy → respect but don't trust         | Trap for technical founders who only signal credentials/status without approachability                        |
| Low Warmth + Low Competence       | Irrelevant              | Contempt → dismiss                     | Not engaging meaningfully; invisible                                                                          |

**The Compensation Effect:** When founders signal too much competence (status, credentials, achievements), audiences automatically perceive them as less warm. The fix: pair every competence signal with a warmth signal.

| Competence Signal                      | Warmth Pairing                                               | Industry Example                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scale / infrastructure achievement     | "...because [people you serve] deserved better"              | EdTech: "100K CCU because students deserved better mocks"; Fintech: "1M transactions because small merchants needed reliability"       |
| Technical innovation                   | "...so that [beneficiary] doesn't need [barrier]"            | AI: "AI agents so small teams compete with companies 10x their size"; Health: "ML diagnostics so rural clinics don't need specialists" |
| Revenue / growth milestone             | "This means we can now [serve/reach/impact] X more [people]" | SaaS: "10K customers means 10K teams saving 5 hours/week"; D2C: "$1M ARR means we can expand to 3 new markets"                         |
| Awards / press mentions                | Share the team who made it happen; credit others             | Any: "Grateful to [team member] who led this; I just stayed out of the way"                                                            |
| Technical deep-dive                    | End with "here's what this means for YOU"                    | Dev tools: "We rewrote the query engine — your dashboards now load in 200ms"; Agency: "New process — your project ships 40% faster"    |
| Prestigious credentials / affiliations | Follow with a relatable failure or learning                  | Any: "Yes, I went to [school], but the real education was the first startup I bankrupted"                                              |
| Fundraising announcement               | Frame as what this enables for users, not validation of you  | Any: "Series A means we can finally build [feature customers have been asking for]"                                                    |

### Defining Your Brand Voice (3-Word Framework)

| Step                         | Action                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. List 13 adjectives        | Describe how you want to be perceived across all contexts         |
| 2. Group into 3 clusters     | Group by similarity; each cluster = one dimension of your voice   |
| 3. Pick one word per cluster | The single word that best captures each group = your 3-word voice |

**Example 3-word voices by archetype:**

| Archetype            | Example 3-Word Voice                  | Why It Works                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Sage (knowledge)     | **Insightful, Direct, Grounded**      | Authority without arrogance; clarity over complexity |
| Creator (innovation) | **Bold, Inventive, Clear**            | Signals innovation while remaining accessible        |
| Hero (empowerment)   | **Courageous, Empowering, Honest**    | Inspires action while staying grounded in truth      |
| Caregiver (support)  | **Warm, Reliable, Thoughtful**        | Nurturing without being patronizing                  |
| Outlaw (disruption)  | **Fearless, Provocative, Authentic**  | Challenges status quo without losing credibility     |
| Ruler (authority)    | **Authoritative, Precise, Confident** | Commands respect through competence                  |
| Explorer (discovery) | **Curious, Adventurous, Open**        | Invites audience into the journey                    |
| Jester (delight)     | **Witty, Playful, Sharp**             | Entertains without losing substance                  |

### Voice vs Tone Across Contexts

Voice is WHO you are (constant). Tone is HOW you say it (context-dependent). Based on Nielsen Norman Group's 4 tone dimensions: funny↔serious, formal↔casual, respectful↔irreverent, enthusiastic↔matter-of-fact.

| Context          | Tone Shift                   | Sage Example                                                    | Creator Example                                                    | Hero Example                                                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LinkedIn post    | Conversational-authoritative | "Here's what 6 months of data taught me about X..."             | "We just shipped something nobody thought was possible..."         | "3 years ago I couldn't get a meeting. Here's what changed..."   |
| X/Twitter thread | Punchy-provocative           | "Hot take: most [industry] advice is backwards. Here's proof."  | "We broke every 'best practice' and got 10x results."              | "Everyone told me this was impossible. Thread on how we did it." |
| Pitch deck       | Authoritative-visionary      | "The data says [market] is shifting. Here's where we sit."      | "We built [innovation] that didn't exist. Here's the proof."       | "This is a $XB problem. We're solving it for [audience]."        |
| Customer support | Empathetic-clear             | "I understand. Here's exactly what's happening and the fix."    | "That shouldn't happen. Here's what we're building to prevent it." | "We've got you. Here's the action plan."                         |
| Blog / long-form | Thoughtful-educational       | "The decision framework behind our architecture..."             | "Why we built X from scratch instead of using Y..."                | "What 500 customers taught us about [problem]..."                |
| Hiring / careers | Warm-ambitious               | "We believe [industry] needs better tools. Help us build them." | "We're doing things nobody else is trying. Here's what's next."    | "Join the team that [mission]. Grow faster than anywhere else."  |

## Kapferer's Brand Identity Prism (Adapted for Founders)

| Facet            | Definition                               | Founder Adaptation                                                                            | Sage Example                                               | Creator Example                                                      | Hero Example                                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Physique**     | Visual & sensory identity                | Profile photo, banner, typography, content design system (see typography-brand-perception.md) | Clean layouts; blue palette; structured carousel templates | Bold colors; showcase of built products; creative visual experiments | High-energy imagery; transformation visuals; before/after  |
| **Personality**  | Brand voice, tone                        | 3-word voice + archetype expression                                                           | "Insightful, Direct, Grounded"                             | "Bold, Inventive, Clear"                                             | "Courageous, Empowering, Honest"                           |
| **Culture**      | Values, origin story                     | Founder values, "why I started this"                                                          | "Knowledge should be accessible, not gatekept"             | "If it doesn't exist, build it"                                      | "Everyone deserves a fair shot"                            |
| **Relationship** | How you engage                           | Mentor? Collaborator? Coach? Peer?                                                            | Mentor/teacher: responds with insight, not just thanks     | Collaborator: invites co-creation, shares process                    | Coach: challenges audience to take action, celebrates wins |
| **Reflection**   | Who your audience aspires to be          | How you portray your ideal follower                                                           | "Thoughtful professionals who build on evidence"           | "Makers who ship, not just plan"                                     | "People who refuse to accept 'that's just how it is'"      |
| **Self-Image**   | How audience sees themselves through you | Identity reinforcement                                                                        | "I learn from practitioners, not theorists"                | "I'm someone who builds, not just consumes"                          | "I'm someone who takes action on hard problems"            |

**Consistency rule:** All 6 facets must align. If Physique says "premium" (dark palette, serif fonts) but Personality says "casual buddy" (Jester voice), the identity fractures. Strong brands show coherence across all facets -- Kapferer's central thesis.

## Aaker's Brand Personality Dimensions (Quantified)

| Dimension      | Traits                                      | Brand Equity Impact (18-year trend)        | When to Lead With                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Competence** | Reliable, intelligent, successful           | **Growing** positive effect on equity      | Technical founders; B2B trust; investor-facing; "we deliver"                         |
| **Excitement** | Daring, spirited, imaginative, contemporary | **Growing** positive effect on equity      | Innovation-led brands; AI-native positioning; Gen Z audience                         |
| Sincerity      | Down-to-earth, honest, wholesome, cheerful  | Declining (still positive but less impact) | Community-first brands; Caregiver archetype; but don't lead with this alone          |
| Sophistication | Upper-class, charming                       | Declining                                  | Premium/luxury positioning; use sparingly                                            |
| Ruggedness     | Outdoorsy, tough                            | Declining                                  | Outdoor/adventure brands; physical product brands; rarely relevant for services/SaaS |

**Key insight:** In 2025, the winning personal brand formula leans into **Competence + Excitement** (growing dimensions) while using Sincerity as a supporting signal (warmth pairing). Archetype mapping: Sage = Competence; Creator/Explorer = Excitement; Caregiver = Sincerity; Magician/Ruler = Sophistication.

| 2. Problem          | What's stopping them (3 levels) | **External:** the tangible obstacle; **Internal:** the self-doubt; **Philosophical:** the injustice |

| 6. Failure          | What happens if they don't act  | Paint the cost of inaction -- lost revenue, missed opportunity, continued pain                      |
| 7. Success          | Transformation achieved         | The identity shift: who does the customer BECOME after working with you?                            |

| Guide authority  | "Built 100K CCU platform"                     | "Reduced deploy time 80% for 500+ teams"       | "Helped 100 startups go from seed to Series B"   | "Nutritionist + food scientist + actual parent"             |

| Success          | "Students fall in love with the exam"         | "Teams deploy daily with confidence"           | "Founder sleeps at night; company grows anyway"  | "Family dinner without the ingredient argument"             |

**The founder trap:** You WANT to be the Hero (showcasing your achievements). But the SB7 says you must be the **Guide**. Your capabilities are PROOF you can guide them, not the story itself. The customer is always the hero.

## Narrative Frameworks for Different Audiences

| Audience                 | Narrative Type      | Structure                                                                       | When to Use                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Clients / customers**  | Guide narrative     | Their problem → your empathy → your capability → their transformation           | LinkedIn posts, sales pages, pitch meetings, case studies          |
| **Investors**            | Builder narrative   | Market gap → unconventional insight → proof of execution → scalable vision      | Pitch decks, investor updates, X threads about traction            |
| **Employees / recruits** | Mission narrative   | Why this matters → how we work differently → what you'll become here            | Career pages, LinkedIn culture posts, hiring threads               |
| **Peers / industry**     | Craftsman narrative | Technical challenge → approach → lessons learned → shared knowledge             | Blog posts, X threads, conference talks, open-source contributions |
| **End users**            | Mentor narrative    | "I understand your struggle → here's what works → this makes it easier"         | Product messaging, onboarding, educational content                 |
| **Press / media**        | Origin narrative    | Founder backstory → the aha moment → early struggle → current traction → vision | Press kits, podcast interviews, profile features                   |

**Key principle:** Same founder, same voice, same archetype -- but DIFFERENT story structure per audience. The Guide narrative works for clients; the Builder narrative works for investors. Never use the same narrative for all audiences.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                                                           | Fix                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No defined archetype (being everything to everyone)                               | Confused brands grow 97% less in value; pick ONE primary, ONE secondary archetype                                                                  |
| All competence, no warmth (credential dumping)                                    | Fiske: triggers envy, not admiration; pair every achievement with "why it matters for YOU"                                                         |
| Being the Hero instead of the Guide                                               | StoryBrand: customers don't want a hero; they want someone who makes THEM the hero; reframe all messaging                                          |
| Voice changes across platforms (LinkedIn = formal, X = casual, email = corporate) | Voice stays constant (3 words); only TONE shifts by context; inconsistency breaks trust (brand consistency = 20%+ revenue)                         |
| Picking archetype based on aspiration, not authenticity                           | Archetype must reflect genuine personality; audiences detect inauthenticity; 80% cite lack of genuineness as trust killer                          |
| Only Sincerity signals ("I'm honest and wholesome")                               | 18-year data: Sincerity's equity impact is declining; lead with Competence + Excitement; Sincerity is supporting, not leading                      |
| Ignoring the warmth-competence trade-off                                          | Compensation effect is real; when you signal high status, perception of warmth drops; deliberately pair warmth cues                                |
| Generic positioning ("I'm a passionate founder")                                  | The "Only I Can Say This" test: if any founder could say it, it's not positioning; your positioning = archetype + unique proof + specific audience |
| Telling your story without connecting to audience transformation                  | Every piece of content must answer: "What does this mean for the person reading this?"                                                             |
| Not using Kapferer Prism for consistency audit                                    | All 6 facets must align; if your visual identity says "premium" but your voice says "casual buddy", the brand is fractured                         |
