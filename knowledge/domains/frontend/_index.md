## Key Principles

1. **Component isolation** - Components should be self-contained
2. **Minimize state** - Only store what you can't derive
3. **Accessibility by default** - Not an afterthought
4. **Performance budget** - Set and enforce limits
5. **Progressive enhancement** - Core functionality without JS
