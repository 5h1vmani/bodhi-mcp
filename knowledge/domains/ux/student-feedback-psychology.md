# Student Feedback Psychology

> How to present performance data without triggering defensiveness or disengagement.

## TL;DR

- **Wise feedback = High standards + Belief in potential** — unbuffered criticism causes defensive reactions
- **Lead with framing, not numbers** — emotional context before data, especially for low performers
- **Autonomy > Data dumps** — give 1-3 specific next actions, not overwhelming analysis
- **Competence need is primary** — students need to feel capable of improvement, not just informed
- **No false praise** — 35% score doesn't need "Good effort!" — needs "Let's build from here"

## Decision Guide

| Scenario                    | Approach                                              | Why                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| High performer (>80%)       | Lead with achievement, then growth opportunities      | They're ready for challenge; celebrate then stretch   |
| Mid-range (50-80%)          | Lead with "solid foundation" + specific recovery      | Validate effort, show concrete path forward           |
| Low performer (<50%)        | Lead with belief statement, minimize score prominence | Prevent shame spiral; pivot immediately to action     |
| Showing negative data       | Pair with specific fix + belief in capability         | Wise feedback: high standards + confidence in student |
| Comparative data (rankings) | Frame as "outperformed X students" not "ranked #Y"    | Positive framing reduces threat response              |
| First-time users            | Emphasize this is a starting point, not judgment      | Establish growth mindset from first interaction       |
| Repeat low performers       | Show improvement from last time, even if small        | Any progress reinforces competence need               |

## Wise Feedback Framework

Synthesized from Cohen, Steele & Ross (1999) and Yeager et al. (2014):

| Component           | What It Means                               | Example                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| High Standards      | Explicit that you expect excellence         | "We hold you to a high bar"                |
| Belief in Potential | Explicit that you believe they can reach it | "We're confident you can meet it"          |
| Specific Path       | Concrete actions to improve                 | "Focus on these 3 topics to gain 38 marks" |

**Critical**: All three components required. High standards alone feels judgmental. Belief alone feels patronizing. Path alone feels overwhelming.

## Self-Determination Theory Application

| Psychological Need | How to Support It                             | Anti-Pattern                            |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Autonomy           | Give choices about what to explore next       | Forcing linear scroll through all data  |
| Competence         | Show specific, achievable improvement actions | Showing problems without solutions      |
| Relatedness        | "Others like you improved by doing X"         | Isolating comparisons ("You're behind") |

## Headline Patterns by Score Range

| Score Range | Headline Pattern                                           | Psychology                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 85%+        | "Strong performance. Let's make it even stronger."         | Acknowledge + growth pull       |
| 70-84%      | "Solid foundation. We found [X] marks you can recover."    | Validate + specific opportunity |
| 50-69%      | "A starting point. Your biggest opportunities are clear."  | No shame, forward-looking       |
| <50%        | "Every expert was once a beginner. Let's build from here." | Normalize struggle, create hope |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                           | Fix                                           |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Leading with the score number     | Lead with emotional framing, then show number |
| "Good job!" for low scores        | Use wise feedback: belief + specific path     |
| Showing all problems at once      | Progressive disclosure: top 3 priorities only |
| Using jargon students don't know  | Plain language: "Fast but wrong" not "Hasty"  |
| Negative framing ("You failed X") | Opportunity framing ("X marks recoverable")   |
| Same UI for all score ranges      | Adapt density and celebration by performance  |
| Data without "So what?"           | Every metric needs an actionable insight      |

## Checklist

- [ ] Emotional framing appears before score number
- [ ] Low scorers (<50%) see belief statement prominently
- [ ] Every negative data point paired with specific action
- [ ] Maximum 3 priority actions shown initially
- [ ] Language tested with actual students for clarity
- [ ] Comparative data framed positively ("outperformed" not "ranked")
- [ ] No false praise for low performers
