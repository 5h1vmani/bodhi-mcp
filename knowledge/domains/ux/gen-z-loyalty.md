## India Market Note

Gen Z in India (under 18) faces stricter data protection under DPDP Act:

- **All under-18 = children** requiring parental consent
- **No behavioral tracking** or targeted advertising allowed for minors
- **No gamification mechanics** that exploit developmental vulnerabilities

If targeting Indian Gen Z users, see [India DPDP](../security/india-dpdp.md) for compliance requirements.
